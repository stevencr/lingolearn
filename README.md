## Technical Points of Interest

### 1. Modern State Management with Redux Toolkit

The `conversationsSlice.tsx` file, as an example, manages all conversation-related state and logic using Redux Toolkit‚Äôs `createSlice` and `createAsyncThunk`. This slice is responsible for handling user and AI messages, message status, and AI-powered assessments.

#### Key Features

- **Message Handling**:

  - `addMessage` and `addUserMessage` reducers add bot and user messages to the conversation state.
  - `markAsPlayed` updates a message‚Äôs status when it has been played (e.g., audio listened).
  - `clearAllMessages` resets the conversation state.

- **Async AI Integration**:

  - Uses `createAsyncThunk` to define `getAIMessageAsync` and `getAIAssessmentAsync` for asynchronous calls to the AI backend (or debug mocks).
  - Handles loading, success, and error states for both message generation and assessment.
  - Integrates with the UI to provide real-time feedback on AI operations.

- **Error and Status Tracking**:

  - The slice tracks the status (`idle`, `loading`, `succeeded`, `failed`) and any errors for robust UI feedback and debugging.

- **Example: Adding a User Message**

```tsx
dispatch(addUserMessage({id: uuid(), message: userInput}));
```

- **Async Thunk Integration with `addCase`**

- **Pattern**:  
  The `addCase` method is used in `extraReducers` to respond to the pending, fulfilled, and rejected states of async thunks like `getAIMessageAsync` and `getAIAssessmentAsync`.
- **Purpose**:  
  This allows the slice to update the conversation state (e.g., loading status, error messages, message content) in response to asynchronous API calls.

- **Example:**

```ts
builder
  .addCase(getAIMessageAsync.pending, state => {
    state.status = 'loading';
  })
  .addCase(getAIMessageAsync.rejected, (state, action) => {
    state.status = 'failed';
    state.error = action.error.message;
  });
```

#### New approach - Dynamically Created Hooks

- **Slices and Async Thunks**:  
  While `conversationsSlice.tsx` exports action creators and selectors, components interact with async logic by dispatching thunks (e.g., `dispatch(getAIMessageAsync(...))`).
- **RTK Query Comparison**:  
  Using RTK Query for conversation APIs will dynamically generate React hooks (like `useGetConversationQuery` or `useSendMessageMutation`). These hooks encapsulate the async logic and state management, providing a more declarative and component-friendly API.

- **Example with RTK Query (not in this slice, but going forward the new way to do it):**

```ts
const {data, isLoading, error} = useGetConversationQuery(conversationId);
```

#### Extensibility

- New reducers or async thunks can be added for additional conversation features (e.g., message reactions, editing).
- The slice is modular and integrates cleanly with other Redux Toolkit slices and RTK Query APIs.

This approach ensures that all conversation logic is centralized, predictable, and easy to maintain, while supporting advanced features like AI-powered messaging and assessments.

This architecture, centered on Redux Toolkit, RTK Query, and modular React Native components, provides a robust foundation for building scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly mobile applications.

## Troubleshooting

### Fix for `react-native-tts` module errors on Android

If you encounter errors related to `react-native-tts`, add the following methods to the `TextToSpeechModule.java` file located at:

`node_modules/react-native-tts/android/src/main/java/net/no_mad/tts/TextToSpeechModule.java`

```java
@ReactMethod
public void addListener(String eventName) {
  // Required for React Native built-in Event Emitter Calls.
}

@ReactMethod
public void removeListeners(Integer count) {
  // Required for React Native built-in Event Emitter Calls.
}
```
